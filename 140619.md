# Today:
1. Run pairwise_pearson.py on the normalized bigwig files.
    * Probably will take a while... Took 24 hours on bam data which was smaller.
2. Investigate potential bug with why the normalized file is so large.
3. Fixed some issues with the normalization (fixed the compression writer.)
4. Resubmit open targets with fixed script.
