Its inverse, the (\textit{k, e})-frequency counts the number of occurrences of each \textit{k}-mer with up to \textit{e} errors in a sequence. The algorithm we present is a magnitude faster than the algorithm in the widely used GEM suite while not relying on heuristics, and can even compute the mappability for short \textit{k}-mers on highly repetitive plant genomes. We also show that mappability can be computed on multiple sequences to identify marker genes illustrated by the example of E. coli strains. GenMap allows exporting the mappability information into different formats such as raw output, wig and bed files.

	abstract = {In vivo protein-DNA interactions connect each transcription factor with its direct targets to form a gene network scaffold. To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element–1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [±50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area ≥ 0.96] and statistical confidence (P {\textless}10–4), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing identify the nearly 2000 specific DNA binding sites for a neuronal transcription factor.

	abstract = {The biological significance of interactions of nuclear proteins with DNA in the context of gene expression, cell differentiation, or disease has immensely been enhanced by the advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP is a technique whereby a protein of interest is selectively immunoprecipitated from a chromatin preparation to determine the DNA sequences associated with it. ChIP has been widely used to map the localization of post-translationally modified histones, histone variants, transcription factors, or chromatin modifying enzymes on the genome or on a given locus. In spite of its power, ChIP has for a long time remained a cumbersome procedure requiring large numbers of cells. These limitations have sparked the development of modifications to shorten the procedure, simplify sample handling and make ChIP amenable to small numbers of cells. In addition, the combination of ChIP with DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies has in recent years enabled the profiling of histone modification, histone variants, and transcription factor occupancy on a genome-wide scale. This review highlights the variations on the theme of the ChIP assay, the various detection methods applied downstream of ChIP, and examples of their application.},

Here we describe Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)— based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adapters into native chromatin – as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple 2-step protocol from 500 to 50,000 cells, and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA binding proteins, individual nucleosomes, and higher-order compaction at regulatory regions with nucleotide resolution. We discover classes of DNA binding factor that strictly avoid, can tolerate, or tend to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq, we measured and interpreted the serial daily epigenomes of resting human T cells from a proband via standard blood draws, demonstrating the feasibility of reading personal epigenomes in clinical timescales for monitoring health and disease.},
