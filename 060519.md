# Comments
1. WiggleTools could be wrong because have to do `wiggletools overlap shift k map.wig shift k neg.wig`
    * Or maybe `wiggletools overlap map.wig shift k neg.wig`???
2. Possible to create binary overlaps?
3. Trim vs overlaps?

# Try
1. Mappability filter on ORIGINAL coverage file, THEN split into pos.wig and neg.wig.
2. Report highest ABS VAL correlation.
    * Doesn't make sense, have the txt file with all correlation values and max wouldn't change anything.
