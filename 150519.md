1. Simulated basic chip seq with chipulate. Fragment size 200, read lengths 36. 10 binding sites on one chromosome.
2. Ran wiggletools and masc.
    * With wiggletools, shift of 167 (fragment length 203)
    * After smoothing (`wiggletools pearson pos.smooth.overlaps.bw shiftPos x neg.smooth.overlaps.bw`), shift of 165, fragment length of 201.
    * MaSC, naive fragment length of 198, MaSC length of 201.
