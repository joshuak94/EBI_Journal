# Today:

1. Wrote out align2rawsignal in wiggletools language.
2. Started mappability calculation for k = 36 using github's human genome index.

# Need to do:
1. Create a sed script to fix the weird chromosome output from the above mappability calculation.
2. Test the fragment length estimator on 5 examples downloaded.
