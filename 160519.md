# Today:
1. Updated the `chipulater_file_gen.py` script to write a sorted file, which gave no errors in chipulate.
2. Attempted to simulate 100000 binding sites on the yeast genome.
3. Work on step 3 of align2rawsignal: smooth weighted sum of read counts (per genomic location x and strand s)
    * Should just be something like `wiggletools write pos.smooth.wig smooth pos.bw` and `wiggletools write neg.smooth.shifted.wig smooth shiftPos FRAGLEN neg.bw`
4. Step four should be: `wiggletools write sum.wig sum pos.smooth.wig neg.smooth.wig`
5. Could combine the above to: `wiggletools write sum.wig sum smooth pos.bw smooth shiftPos FRAGLEN neg.bw`
6. Downloaded new dataset from ENCODE to test on.

# Questions:
1. Align2rawsignal differentiates between 0 values and empty values (0 values = no signal, empty values = not mappable).
    * How should I get that difference? One possibility:
    `wiggletools write pos.overlaps.wig offset 1 unit overlaps map.wig offset -1 pos.wig`
    Another possibility is to use strict.
