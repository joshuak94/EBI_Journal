# Comments:
1. Attempted to use UCSC wigCorrelate:
```sh
wiggletools write neg.shifted137.overlaps.wig shiftPos 137 neg.overlaps.wig
../../wigCorrelate pos.overlaps.wig neg.shifted137.overlaps.wig
# Results in correlation of 0.627, compared to 0.64229 for pos.overlaps.wig and neg.overlaps.wig
[joshjayk@ebi-cli-003 wiggletools_masc]$ ../../wigCorrelate neg.shifted-137.overlaps.wig pos.overlaps.wig
neg.shifted-137.overlaps.wig	pos.overlaps.wig	0.678409
```
    * Something with shiftPos is incorrect???
    * Visualize pos.overlaps.bw, neg.overlaps.bw and neg.shifted137.overlaps.bw on IGV.
2. Extended `wiggletools_max_shift.py` to include calling wigCorrelate optionally.
    * Tested for shifts from -400 to 400.
    ```sh
    [joshjayk@ebi-cli-001 wiggletools_masc]$ bsub -M 16384 -R "rusage[mem=16384, scratch=16384]" -n 16 -J wigCorrelateNeg python wiggletools_max_shift.py -c 16 -i -1 -e -400 -s -1 -w -p pos.overlaps.wig -n neg.overlaps.wig -o wigCorrelate/wigCorrelateNeg.out

    ```
3. Enabled plotting from the script above, converted arrays to numpy arrays.

# Questions:
1. Why are wigCorrelate, MaSC and wiggletools all giving different results???
    * MaSC was run on heart_adult_8_weeks_H3K27me3_ENCODE_854_no_duplicates.bed
    * wiggletools: Filtered original bam file for only chromosomes 1...Y, masked with mappability vector, then shift and calculate pearson.
    * wigCorrelate: Same as above.
